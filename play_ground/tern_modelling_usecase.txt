2. As a developer I want to be able to understand the RDF data model.

3. As a developer I want to be able to understand RDF data storage formats (e.g. TTL, n3, etc)

4. As a developer I want to be able to understand and generate TDB database storage system.

5. As a developer I want to be able to understand SPARQL RDF query language.

6. As a developer I want to be able to understand and install Apache Jena Fuseki (SPARQL server)

8. As a developer I want to be able to understand TERN plot data modelling (as designed and described by Simon Cox)

9. As a developer I want to be able to code Python programs/scripts to generate SQL queries to relational databases(Tern plot data sources) to produce data
